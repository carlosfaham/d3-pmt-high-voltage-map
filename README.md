# d3-pmt-high-voltage-map
A D3.js visualization map demo for LUX showing the photodetector voltages and currents.

The data is static in this demo. In the actual production example used in the LUX experiment's slow control system, the data is pulled dynamically from a MySQL database for real-time monitoring.
